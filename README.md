# SG Tweep Python Study Group (2019) Exercise 4

## Objective 
This exercise aims to allow students to practise creating their own function.

## Scenario & Task
Functions are a very useful concept in programming to make your code clean, flexibility and scalable. It is hard to understand this during learning phase because the code is always very short. But hopefully you will have an opportunity to appreciate functions in the future. 

Here's the exercise for this week:

Given 4 lines of text

```py
line1="1+1"
line2="2-1"
line3="4*5"
line4="4/2"
```

Write a function to calculate the output of each line. 

```py
def calculate(line):
    # magic happens here

calculate(line1)
calculate(line2)
calculate(line3)
calculate(line4)
```

## Expected Output
Expected output should look like this:

```py
2
1
20
2.0
```
